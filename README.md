# Tombok
Lombok for TypeScript

## Development Status
This is under heavy development while decorators are still being ironed out at the ECMA level. See the decorator proposal for details:
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators

I'm following the status of that proposal closely and am keeping this library up-to-date with the goal of making it production ready shortly after its official inclusion in the specification.

The first release will contain only a very small subset of Lombok-like functionality (e.g. `@Builder`, `@AllArgsConstructor`) with more functionality rolled out through future releases. The idea is to get it out in the wild as quickly as possible, addressing first my immediate needs (hence why I started this project), followed by whatever is highly requested. We'll iron out that process once we get there.

I expect that this will grow into something distinct from Lombok as the languages they serve are distinct from one another.
